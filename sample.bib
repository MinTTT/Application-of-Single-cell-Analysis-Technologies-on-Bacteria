We describe here an extension to the soft lithography paradigm, multilayer soft lithography, with which devices consisting of multiple layers may be fabricated from soft materials. We used this technique to build active microfluidic systems containing on-off valves, switching valves, and pumps entirely out of elastomer. The softness of these materials allows the device areas to be reduced by more than two orders of magnitude compared with silicon-based devices. The other advantages of soft lithography, such as rapid prototyping, ease of fabrication, and biocompatibility, are retained.},

abstract = {With the expanding interest in cellular responses to dynamic environments, microfluidic devices have become important experimental platforms for biological research. Microfluidic “microchemostat” devices enable precise environmental control while capturing high quality, single-cell gene expression data. For studies of population heterogeneity and gene expression noise, these abilities are crucial. Here, we describe the necessary steps for experimental microfluidics using devices created in our lab as examples. First, we discuss the rational design of microchemostats and the tools available to predict their performance. We carefully analyze the critical parts of an example device, focusing on the most important part of any microchemostat: the cell trap. Next, we present a method for generating on-chip dynamic environments using an integrated fluidic junction coupled to linear actuators. Our system relies on the simple modulation of hydrostatic pressure to alter the mixing ratio between two source reservoirs and we detail the software and hardware behind it. To expand the throughput of microchemostat experiments, we describe how to build larger, parallel versions of simpler devices. To analyze the large amounts of data, we discuss methods for automated cell tracking, focusing on the special problems presented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The manufacturing of microchemostats is described in complete detail: from the photolithographic processing of the wafer to the final bonding of the PDMS chip to glass coverslip. Finally, the procedures for conducting Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae microchemostat experiments are addressed.},

The method makes it possible to analyse the rate of gene expression at the level of single proteins over the bacterial cell cycle. We also demonstrate that it is possible to count the number of non-specifically DNA binding LacI-Venus molecules using short excitation light pulses. The transcription factors are localized on the nucleoids in the cell and appear to be uniformly distributed on chromosomal DNA. An increase in the expression of LacI is observed at the beginning of the cell cycle, possibly because some gene copies are de-repressed as a result of partitioning inequalities at cell division. Finally, a size-growth rate uncertainty relation is observed where cells living in rich media vary more in the length at birth than in generation time, and the opposite is true for cells living in poorer media.},

abstract = {Biochemical and genetic data show that ribosomes closely follow RNA polymerases that are transcribing protein-coding genes in bacteria. At the same time, electron and fluorescence microscopy have revealed that ribosomes are excluded from the Escherichia coli nucleoid, which seems to be inconsistent with fast translation initiation on nascent mRNA transcripts. The apparent paradox can be reconciled if translation of nascent mRNAs can start throughout the nucleoid before they relocate to the periphery. However, this mechanism requires that free ribosomal subunits are not excluded from the nucleoid. Here, we use single-particle tracking in living E. coli cells to determine the fractions of free ribosomal subunits, classify individual subunits as free or mRNA-bound, and quantify the degree of exclusion of bound and free subunits separately. We show that free subunits are not excluded from the nucleoid. This finding strongly suggests that translation of nascent mRNAs can start throughout the nucleoid, which reconciles the spatial separation of DNA and ribosomes with cotranscriptional translation. We also show that, after translation inhibition, free subunit precursors are partially excluded from the compacted nucleoid. This finding indicates that it is active translation that normally allows ribosomal subunits to assemble on nascent mRNAs throughout the nucleoid and that the effects of translation inhibitors are enhanced by the limited access of ribosomal subunits to nascent mRNAs in the compacted nucleoid.},

abstract = {Cell size control is an intrinsic feature of the cell cycle. In bacteria, cell growth and division are thought to be coupled through a cell size threshold. Here, we provide direct experimental evidence disproving the critical size paradigm. Instead, we show through single-cell microscopy and modeling that the evolutionarily distant bacteria Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus achieve cell size homeostasis by growing, on average, the same amount between divisions, irrespective of cell length at birth. This simple mechanism provides a remarkably robust cell size control without the need of being precise, abating size deviations exponentially within a few generations. This size homeostasis mechanism is broadly applicable for symmetric and asymmetric divisions, as well as for different growth rates. Furthermore, our data suggest that constant size extension is implemented at or close to division. Altogether, our findings provide fundamentally distinct governing principles for cell size and cell-cycle control in bacteria.},

abstract = {Isogenic E. coli cells growing in a constant environment display significant variability in growth rates, division sizes, and generation times. The guiding principle appears to be that each cell, during one generation, adds a size increment that is uncorrelated to its birth size. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying this “adder” behavior by mapping the chromosome replication cycle to the division cycle of individual cells using fluorescence microscopy. We have found that initiation of chromosome replication is triggered at a fixed volume per chromosome independent of a cell's birth volume and growth rate. Each initiation event is coupled to a division event after a growth-rate-dependent time. We formalize our findings in a model showing that cell-to-cell variation in division timing and cell size is mainly driven by variations in growth rate. The model also explains why fast-growing cells display adder behavior and correctly predict deviations from the adder behavior at slow growth.},

Predicting population growth characteristics based on knowledge of heterogeneous single-cell dynamics remains challenging. By observing groups of cells for hundreds of generations at single-cell resolution, we reveal that growth noise causes clonal populations of Escherichia coli to double faster than the mean doubling time of their constituent single cells across a broad set of balanced-growth conditions. We show that the population-level growth rate gain as well as age structures of populations and of cell lineages in competition are predictable. Furthermore, we theoretically reveal that the growth rate gain can be linked with the relative entropy of lineage generation time distributions. Unexpectedly, we find an empirical linear relation between the means and the variances of generation times across conditions, which provides a general constraint on maximal growth rates. Together, these results demonstrate a fundamental benefit of noise for population growth, and identify a growth law that sets a “speed limit” for proliferation.},

@article{Rowat2009,
abstract = {Cells within a genetically identical population exhibit phenotypic variation that in some cases can persist across multiple generations. However, information about the temporal variation and familial dependence of protein levels remains hidden when studying the population as an ensemble. To correlate phenotypes with the age and genealogy of single cells over time, we developed a microfluidic device that enables us to track multiple lineages in parallel by trapping single cells and constraining them to grow in lines for as many as 8 divisions. To illustrate the utility of this method, we investigate lineages of cells expressing one of 3 naturally regulated proteins, each with a different representative expression behavior. Within lineages deriving from single cells, we observe genealogically related clusters of cells with similar phenotype; cluster sizes vary markedly among the 3 proteins, suggesting that the time scale of phenotypic persistence is protein-specific. Growing lines of cells also allows us to dynamically track temporal fluctuations in protein levels at the same time as pedigree relationships among the cells as they divide in the chambers. We observe bursts in expression levels of the heat shock protein Hsp12-GFP that occur simultaneously in mother and daughter cells. In contrast, the ribosomal protein Rps8b-GFP shows relatively constant levels of expression over time. This method is an essential step toward understanding the time scales of phenotypic variation and correlations in phenotype among single cells within a population.},

Monitoring a large number of cells is desired to collect data of statistical significance, from which one can address key biological questions. However, traditional cell-immobilization techniques (i.e., agar pads) limit the possibility of large data collection as colonies can rapidly outgrow a field of view and use up available nutrients. Here, we present a protocol for fabrication of a microfluidic device, the ``mother machine'', that allows long-term growth experiment on rod-shaped cells. In a mother machine, continuous flow of growth medium provides nutrients for growing cells and clears the device of excess cells. The device is assembled on a glass-bottom dish from which we can perform multi-point time-lapse microscopy. The design has approximately 1,000 growth channels per device, which allow us capturing data on more than 105 individual cells in one single experiment.",

abstract = {The quantitative study of the cell growth [1-5] has led to many fundamental insights in our understanding of a wide range of subjects, from the cell cycle [6-9] to senescence [10]. Of particular importance is the growth rate, whose constancy represents a physiological steady state of an organism. Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically [11] and symmetrically [12, 13] dividing organisms, implying that a "steady-state" population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady-state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age. Our analysis of approximately 105 individual cells reveals a remarkable stability of growth whereby the mother cell inherits the same pole for hundreds of generations. We further show that death of E. coli is not purely stochastic but is the result of accumulating damages. We conclude that E. coli, unlike all other aging model systems studied to date, has a robust mechanism of growth that is decoupled from cell death. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {When musing about evolution, the physician and scientific essayist Lewis Thomas wrote, “The capacity to blunder slightly is the real marvel of DNA. Without this special attribute, we would still be anaerobic bacteria and there would be no music” (1). Understanding how DNA mutations arise in cells, either spontaneously or after damage, has been a central question for scientists since the discovery of the structure of DNA over six decades ago. Since that time, significant progress on defining how DNA is damaged by processes external and internal to the cell has been made. Furthermore, several DNA repair pathways have been investigated at the molecular level and have been shown to reverse these genomic injuries, often including feedback mechanisms that up-regulate repair once severe damage is detected. In recognition of this significant mechanistic research in the field of genome stability, two important prizes were awarded in 2015: the Lasker Award to Stephen Elledge and Evelyn Witkin, and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Tomas Lindahl, Paul Modrich, and Aziz Sancar. Mismatch repair (MMR), worked out in detail by Modrich (2) and his colleagues, is comparable to the backspace button on our computers to correct typing errors. This process, conserved through all kingdoms of life, acts to eliminate replication errors that occur when a DNA polymerase places the wrong nucleotide triphosphate opposite its appropriate template or opposite a damaged nucleobase, diminishing DNA replication fidelity. The newly synthesized strand is marked by its temporary lack of methylation and it is this feature that allows MMR to fix the newly introduced errors. In Escherichia coli , MMR is mediated by three key proteins: MutS, MutL, and MutH. MutS recognizes the mismatch and loads multiple copies of MutL next to the lesion. These molecules translocate along the DNA to locate the MutH endonuclease, which is {\ldots}

It is often unclear how much of this variation derives from chance, external signals, or attempts by individual cells to exert autonomous phenotypic programs. By observing thousands of cells for hundreds of consecutive generations under constant conditions, we dissect the stochastic decision between a solitary, motile state and a chained, sessile state in Bacillus subtilis. We show that the motile state is 'memoryless', exhibiting no autonomous control over the time spent in the state. In contrast, the time spent as connected chains of cells is tightly controlled, enforcing coordination among related cells in the multicellular state. We show that the three-protein regulatory circuit governing the decision is modular, as initiation and maintenance of chaining are genetically separable functions. As stimulation of the same initiating pathway triggers biofilm formation, we argue that autonomous timing allows a trial commitment to multicellularity that external signals could extend.},

abstract = {How cells control their size and maintain size homeostasis is a fundamental open question. Cell-size homeostasis has been discussed in the context of two major paradigms: "sizer," in which the cell actively monitors its size and triggers the cell cycle once it reaches a critical size, and "timer," in which the cell attempts to grow for a specific amount of time before division. These paradigms, in conjunction with the "growth law" [1] and the quantitative bacterial cell-cycle model [2], inspired numerous theoretical models [3-9] and experimental investigations, from growth [10, 11] to cell cycle and size control [12-15]. However, experimental evidence involved difficult-to-verify assumptions or population-averaged data, which allowed different interpretations [1-5, 16-20] or limited conclusions [4-9]. In particular, population-averaged data and correlations are inconclusive as the averaging process masks causal effects at the cellular level. In this work, we extended a microfluidic "mother machine" [21] and monitored hundreds of thousands of Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis cells under a wide range of steady-state growth conditions. Our combined experimental results and quantitative analysis demonstrate that cells add a constant volume each generation, irrespective of their newborn sizes, conclusively supporting the so-called constant $\Delta$ model. This model was introduced for E. coli [6, 7] and recently revisited [9], but experimental evidence was limited to correlations. This "adder" principle quantitatively explains experimental data at both the population and single-cell levels, including the origin and the hierarchy of variability in the size-control mechanisms and how cells maintain size homeostasis.},

abstract = {The coordination of cell growth and division is a long-standing problem in biology. Focusing on Escherichia coli in steady growth, we quantify cell division control using a stochastic model, by inferring the division rate as a function of the observable parameters from large empirical datasets of dividing cells. We find that (i) cells have mechanisms to control their size, (ii) size control is effected by changes in the doubling time, rather than in the single- cell elongation rate, (iii) the division rate increases steeply with cell size for small cells, and saturates for larger cells. Importantly, (iv) the current size is not the only variable controlling cell division, but the time spent in the cell cycle appears to play a role, and (v) common tests of cell size control may fail when such concerted control is in place. Our analysis illustrates the mechanisms of cell division control in E. coli. The phenomenological framework presented is sufficiently general to be widely applicable and opens the way for rigorous tests of molecular cell-cycle models.},

@article{Tanouchi2015,
abstract = {During bacterial growth, a cell approximately doubles in size before division, after which it splits into two daughter cells. This process is subjected to the inherent perturbations of cellular noise and thus requires regulation for cell-size homeostasis. The mechanisms underlying the control and dynamics of cell size remain poorly understood owing to the difficulty in sizing individual bacteria over long periods of time in a high-throughput manner. Here we measure and analyse long-term, single-cell growth and division across different Escherichia coli strains and growth conditions. We show that a subset of cells in a population exhibit transient oscillations in cell size with periods that stretch across several (more than ten) generations. Our analysis reveals that a simple law governing cell-size control-a noisy linear map-explains the origins of these cell-size oscillations across all strains. This noisy linear map implements a negative feedback on cell-size control: a cell with a larger initial size tends to divide earlier, whereas one with a smaller initial size tends to divide later. Combining simulations of cell growth and division with experimental data, we demonstrate that this noisy linear map generates transient oscillations, not just in cell size, but also in constitutive gene expression. Our work provides new insights into the dynamics of bacterial cell-size regulation with implications for the physiological processes involved.},

Using spatially extended arrays of microdroplets, we study the diffusion of both AHL and IPTG from inducer-filled reservoirs into bacteria-containing droplets, and also from droplets with AHL producing sender bacteria into neighboring droplets containing receiver cells. Computational modeling of gene expression dynamics within the droplets suggests a strongly reduced effective diffusion coefficient of the inducers, which markedly affects the spatial communication pattern in the neighborhood of the senders. Engineered bacteria that integrate AHL and IPTG signals with a synthetic AND gate gene circuit are shown to respond only in the presence of both types of sender droplets, which demonstrates the potential of the system for genetically programmed pattern formation and distributed computing.},

abstract = {The explosive growth in our knowledge of genomes, proteomes, and metabolomes is driving ever-increasing fundamental under- standing of the biochemistry of life, enabling qualitatively new studies of complex biological systems and their evolution. This knowledge also drives modern biotechnologies, such as molecular engineering and synthetic biology, which have enormous potential to address urgent problems, including developing potent new drugs and providing environmentally friendly energy. Many of these studies, however, are ultimately limited by their need for even-higher-throughput measurements of biochemical reactions. We present a general ultrahigh-throughput screening platform using drop-based microfluidics that overcomes these limitations and revolutionizes both the scale and speed of screening. We use aqueous drops dispersed in oil as picoliter-volume reaction vessels and screen them at rates of thousands per second. To dem- onstrate its power, we apply the system to directed evolution, identifyingnew mutants of the enzyme horseradish peroxidase ex- hibiting catalytic rates more than 10 times faster than their parent, which is already a very efficient enzyme. We exploit the ultrahigh throughput to use an initial purifying selection that removes inac- tive mutants; we identify ∼100 variants comparable in activity to the parent from an initial population of ∼107. After a second gen- eration of mutagenesis and high-stringency screening, we identify several significantly improved mutants, some approaching diffu- sion-limited efficiency. In total, we screen ∼108 individual enzyme reactions in only 10 h, using {\textless}150 $\mu$L of total reagent volume; compared to state-of-the-art robotic screening systems, we per- form the entire assay with a 1,000-fold increase in speed and a 1-million-fold reduction in cost.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of complex enzymatic reactions in highly crowded small volumes is crucial for the development of synthetic minimal cells. Compartmentalized biochemical reactions in cell-sized containers exhibit a degree of randomness due to the small number of molecules involved. However, it is unknown how the physical environment contributes to the stochastic nature of multistep enzymatic processes. Here, we present a robust method to quantify gene expression noise in vitro using droplet microfluidics. We study the changes in stochasticity in the cell-free gene expression of two genes compartmentalized within droplets as a function of DNA copy number and macromolecular crowding. We find that decreased diffusion caused by a crowded environment leads to the spontaneous formation of heterogeneous microenvironments of mRNA as local production rates exceed the diffusion rates of macromolecules. This heterogeneity leads to a higher probability of the molecular machinery staying in the same microenvironment, directly increasing the system's stochasticity.},

Drop-seq analyzes mRNA transcripts from thousands of individual cells simultaneously while remembering transcripts' cell of origin. We analyzed transcriptomes from 44,808 mouse retinal cells and identified 39 transcriptionally distinct cell populations, creating a molecular atlas of gene expression for known retinal cell classes and novel candidate cell subtypes.

abstract = {The field of microbiology has traditionally been concerned with and focused on studies at the population level. Information on how cells respond to their environment, interact with each other, or undergo complex processes such as cellular differentiation or gene expression has been obtained mostly by inference from population-level data. Individual microorganisms, even those in supposedly "clonal" populations, may differ widely from each other in terms of their genetic composition, physiology, biochemistry, or behavior. This genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity has important practical consequences for a number of human interests, including antibiotic or biocide resistance, the productivity and stability of industrial fermentations, the efficacy of food preservatives, and the potential of pathogens to cause disease. New appreciation of the importance of cellular heterogeneity, coupled with recent advances in technology, has driven the development of new tools and techniques for the study of individual microbial cells. Because observations made at the single-cell level are not subject to the "averaging" effects characteristic of bulk-phase, population-level methods, they offer the unique capacity to observe discrete microbiological phenomena unavailable using traditional approaches. As a result, scientists have been able to characterize microorganisms, their activities, and their interactions at unprecedented levels of detail.},

Formaldehyde-fixed, intact cells were hybridized with fluorescently labeled oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Because of the abundance of rRNA in cells, the binding of the fluorescent probes to individual cells is readily visualized. Phylogenetic identification is achieved by the use of oligonucleotides (length 17 to 34 nucleotides) that are complementary to phylogenetic group-specific 16S rRNA sequences. Appropriate probes can be composed of oligonucleotide sequences that distinguish between the primary kingdoms (eukaryotes, eubacteria, archaebacteria) and between closely related organisms. The simultaneous use of multiple probes, labeled with different fluorescent dyes, allows the identification of different cell types in the same microscopic field. Quantitative microfluorimetry shows that the amount of an rRNA-specific probe that binds to Escherichia coli varies with the ribosome content and therefore reflects growth rate.},

Samples of glass-attached biofilms and plankton were taken from a Robbins device installed in a water distribution system. More than 70{\%} of the surface-associated cells and less than 40{\%} of the planktonic cells visualized by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining bound detectable amounts of rRNA-targeted probes. These findings are an indication for higher average rRNA content and consequently higher physiological activity of the attached microbial cells compared with the free-living cells. All detectable cells hybridized with the bacterial probe, whereas no Archaea and no Eucarya cells could be detected. Simultaneous hybridization with probes specific for the beta and gamma subclasses of Proteobacteria revealed that microcolonies already consisted of mixed populations in early stages with fewer than 50 cells. These observations provide further evidence that the coexistence and interaction of bacteria in drinking water biofilms may be an integral part of their growth and survival strategies.},

abstract = {In situ hybridization of whole cells with rRNA-targeted, fluorescently labelled oligonucleotide probes is a powerful method to specifically detect microorganisms in their natural habitat without cultivation and subsequent identification by phenotypic characterization. To examine the use of this method for the specific detection of pathogenic Candida species, we have designed an oligonucleotide probe which binds to the 18S rRNA of C. albicans and C. tropicalis, the two most important pathogenic Candida species, and differentiates them from other clinically relevant species. After establishing suitable hybridization conditions, we confirmed the specificity of our probe O20 in RNA dot blot hybridizations with a series of reference strains and clinical isolates of medically important Candida species. All C. albicans and C. tropicalis strains hybridized with the probe, whereas all strains of C. parapsilosis, C. glabrata, C. krusei, C. guilliermondii, C. kefyr and C. lusitaniae did not. When we used the fluorescently labelled probe O20 to specifically detect single cells of the two target species by in situ hybridization, both C. albicans and C. tropicalis reacted strongly with the probe and could be clearly differentiated from C. krusei and C. parapsilosis, although the latter organism contains only two nucleotide mismatches in the probe target region. This discrimination capacity was also seen when mixed suspensions of C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were hybridized with the probe. After infection of a human endothelial cell line with C. albicans and C. krusei, C. albicans cells adhering to the endothelial cells were easily distinguishable from the C. krusei cells by fluorescent in situ hybridization with probe O20. In addition, germ tubes and hyphae of C. albicans were also efficiently labelled. The application of fluorescently labelled rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes therefore appears to be a valuable tool for the specific detection and identification of different members of the genus Candida, which does not require any cultivation.},

Ethanol fixation and enzymatic pretreatment with lysozyme and proteinase K were used to optimize whole cell hybridization of exponential phase and stationary phase Listeria spp. cells. In parallel, transcript probes carrying multiple digoxigenin molecules were combined with anti-digoxigenin Fab antibody fragments labeled with horseradish peroxidase to detect, via the catalytic deposition of fluorescein-tyramide, the iap-mRNA in single Listeria monocytogenes cells. The iap gene encodes the associated virulence factor p60. Application of the new signal amplification technique resulted in strong signals comparable in intensity to those obtained with fluorescently labeled rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes.},

abstract = {Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using rRNA targeted oligonucleotide probes is a standard method for identification of microorganisms in environmental samples. Apart from its value as a phylogenetic marker ribosomal RNA has always been the favoured target molecule for FISH because of its abundance in all cells, whereas plasmids and DNA were regarded as unsuitable targets because of their low copy number. Here we present an improved FISH technique, which is based on polynucleotide probes. It goes beyond the detection of high copy intracellular nucleic acids such as rRNA (up to 10(4)-10(5) copies per cell) and allows for the first time the in situ detection of individual genes or gene fragments on plasmids (10(1)-10(3) copies per cell) and chromosomal DNA ({\textless}10 copies per cell) in a single cell. Using E. coli as model organism we were able to detect in situ cells harbouring the antibiotic resistance gene beta lactamase on high, medium and low copy plasmids as well as the chromosomal encoded housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Furthermore, we detected the prepilin peptidase gene xpsO in the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris in situ. Because of the characteristic hybridization signal obtained with this method--a halo-like, ring-shaped concentration of fluorescence in the cell periphery--we coined the term RING-FISH (recognition of individual genes) to differentiate it from conventional FISH.},

abstract = {A combination of fluorescent rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes (“phylogenetic stains”) and flow cytometry was used for a high resolution automated analysis of mixed microbial populations. Fixed cells of bacteria and yeasts were hybridized in suspension with fluorescein- or tetramethylrhodamine-labeled oligonucleotide probes complementary to group-specific regions of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) molecules. Quantifying probe-conferred cell fluorescence by flow cytometry, we could discriminate between target and nontarget cell populations. We critically examined changes of the hybridization conditions, kinetics of the hybridization, and posthybridization treatments. Intermediate probe concentrations, addition of detergent to the hybridization buffer, and a posthybridization washing step were found to increase the signal to noise ratio. We could demonstrate a linear correlation between growth rate and probe-conferred fluorescence of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas cepacia cells. Oligonucleotides labeled with multiple fluorochromes showed elevated levels of non-specific binding and therefore could not be used to lower the detection limits, which still restrict studies with fluorescing rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes to well-growing microbial cells. Two probes of different specificities—one labeled with fluorescein, the other with tetramethylrhodamine—could be applied simultaneously for dual color analysis. {\textcopyright} 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Progress toward these goals has been substantial, and near-infrared emitting FPs may loom over the horizon. The latest efforts in jellyfish variants have resulted in new and improved monomeric BFP, CFP, GFP and YFP variants, and the relentless search for a bright, monomeric and fast-maturing red FP has yielded a host of excellent candidates, although none is yet optimal for all applications.

abstract = {Many cnidarians utilize green-fluorescent proteins (GFPs) as energy-transfer acceptors in bioluminescence. GFPs fluoresce in vivo upon receiving energy from either a luciferase-oxyluciferin excited-state complex or a Ca2+-activated photoprotein. These highly fluorescent proteins are unique due to the chemical nature of their chromophore, which is comprised of modified amino acid (aa) residues within the polypeptide. This report describes the cloning and sequencing of both cDNA and genomic clones of GFP from the cnidarian, Aequorea victoria. The gfp10 cDNA encodes a 238-aa-residue polypeptide with a calculated Mrof 26888. Comparsion of A. victoria GFP genomic clones shows three different restriction enzyme patterns which suggests that at least three different genes are present in the A. victoria population at Friday Harbor, Washington. The gfp gene encoded by the $\lambda$GFP2 genomic clone is comprised of at least three exons spread over 2.6 kb. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNA and the gene will aid in the elucidation of structure-function relationships in this unique class of proteins. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Addn. of Ca++ in an amt. at least the molar equiv. to that of EDTA present produced a flash of light. No other ion could replace Ca++. The rate of light emission followed 1st order reaction kinetics; O was not necessary and only a single component (in addn. to Ca++) could be identified. Total light produced decreased with rise in temp. from 0° to 40° and was independent of pH between 5.1 and 8.3. The rate of emission was nearly const. between pH 6.5 and 7.5, decreasing at lower and increasing at higher values. Malonate, EDTA, and a series of aliphatic aldehydes (C3-C7) reversibly inhibited the rate but not the total of light emission. Aromatic aldehydes, inorg. reducing or strong oxidizing agents, p-ClHgC6H4CO2H, HgCl2, N1-methylnicotinamide chloride, hydroquinone, benzoquinone, histidine-HCl, dinitrofluorobenzene-NaHCO3, and NCCH2CO2H reduced the total light without affecting the rate of emission; H2O2 had no effect. Aliphatic alcs. increased light emission; C6H5CH2OH caused a slight decrease. The absorption spectrum of I shows a max. at 280 m$\mu$ with a bulge at 310 m$\mu$. In the luminescent reaction the bulge is replaced by a new max. at 333 m$\mu$. These changes suggest the presence of a reduced pyridinium deriv. combined with the protein. [on SciFinder(R)]},

Here, we present the mechanism in bacteria. We developed a high-throughput, in vitro, single-molecule assay to follow transcription on individual DNA templates in real time. We showed that positive supercoiling buildup on a DNA segment by transcription slows down transcription elongation and eventually stops transcription initiation. Transcription can be resumed upon gyrase binding to the DNA segment. Furthermore, using single-cell mRNA counting fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we found that duty cycles of transcriptional bursting depend on the intracellular gyrase concentration. Together, these findings prove that transcriptional bursting of highly expressed genes in bacteria is primarily caused by reversible gyrase dissociation from and rebinding to a DNA segment, changing the supercoiling level of the segment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The SOS genetic network is responsible for the repair/bypass of DNA damage in bacterial cells. While the initial stages of the response have been well characterized, less is known about the dynamics of the response after induction and its shutoff. To address this, we followed the response of the SOS network in living individual Escherichia coli cells. The promoter activity (PA) of SOS genes was monitored using fluorescent protein-promoter fusions, with high temporal resolution, after ultraviolet irradiation activation. We find a temporal pattern of discrete activity peaks masked in studies of cell populations. The number of peaks increases, while their amplitude reaches saturation, as the damage level is increased. Peak timing is highly precise from cell to cell and is independent of the stage in the cell cycle at the time of damage. Evidence is presented for the involvement of the umuDC operon in maintaining the pattern of PA and its temporal precision, providing further evidence for the role UmuD cleavage plays in effecting a timed pause during the SOS response, as previously proposed. The modulations in PA we observe share many features in common with the oscillatory behavior recently observed in a mammalian DNA damage response. Our results, which reveal a hitherto unknown modulation of the SOS response, underscore the importance of carrying out dynamic measurements at the level of individual living cells in order to unravel how a natural genetic network operates at the systems level.},

We show that the motile state is 'memoryless', exhibiting no autonomous control over the time spent in the state. In contrast, the time spent as connected chains of cells is tightly controlled, enforcing coordination among related cells in the multicellular state. We show that the three-protein regulatory circuit governing the decision is modular, as initiation and maintenance of chaining are genetically separable functions. As stimulation of the same initiating pathway triggers biofilm formation, we argue that autonomous timing allows a trial commitment to multicellularity that external signals could extend.},

abstract = {Genetic programs function to integrate environmental sensors, implement signal processing algorithms and control expression dynamics. These programs consist of integrated genetic circuits that individually implement operations ranging from digital logic to dynamic circuits, and they have been used in various cellular engineering applications, including the implementation of process control in metabolic networks and the coordination of spatial differentiation in artificial tissues. A key limitation is that the circuits are based on biochemical interactions occurring in the confined volume of the cell, so the size of programs has been limited to a few circuits. Here we apply part mining and directed evolution to build a set of transcriptional AND gates in Escherichia coli. Each AND gate integrates two promoter inputs and controls one promoter output. This allows the gates to be layered by having the output promoter of an upstream circuit serve as the input promoter for a downstream circuit. Each gate consists of a transcription factor that requires a second chaperone protein to activate the output promoter. Multiple activator-chaperone pairs are identified from type III secretion pathways in different strains of bacteria. Directed evolution is applied to increase the dynamic range and orthogonality of the circuits. These gates are connected in different permutations to form programs, the largest of which is a 4-input AND gate that consists of 3 circuits that integrate 4 inducible systems, thus requiring 11 regulatory proteins. Measuring the performance of individual gates is sufficient to capture the behaviour of the complete program. Errors in the output due to delays (faults), a common problem for layered circuits, are not observed. This work demonstrates the successful layering of orthogonal logic gates, a design strategy that could enable the construction of large, integrated circuits in single cells.},

Here we constructed an orthogonal AND gate in Escherichia coli using a novel hetero-regulation module from Pseudomonas syringae. The device comprises two co-activating genes hrpR and hrpS controlled by separate promoter inputs, and a $\sigma$(54)-dependent hrpL promoter driving the output. The hrpL promoter is activated only when both genes are expressed, generating digital-like AND integration behaviour. The AND gate is demonstrated to be modular by applying new regulated promoters to the inputs, and connecting the output to a NOT gate module to produce a combinatorial NAND gate. The circuits were assembled using a parts-based engineering approach of quantitative characterization, modelling, followed by construction and testing. The results show that new genetic logic devices can be engineered predictably from novel native orthogonal biological control elements using quantitatively in-context characterized parts.},

abstract = {Genetic circuits require many regulatory parts in order to implement signal processing or execute algorithms in cells. A potentially scalable approach is to use dCas9, which employs small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) to repress genetic loci via the programmability of RNA:DNA base pairing. To this end, we use dCas9 and designed sgRNAs to build transcriptional logic gates and connect them to perform computation in living cells. We constructed a set of NOT gates by designing five synthetic Escherichia coli $\sigma$70 promoters that are repressed by corresponding sgRNAs, and these interactions do not exhibit crosstalk between each other. These sgRNAs exhibit high on-target repression (56- to 440-fold) and negligible off-target interactions ({\textless} 1.3-fold). These gates were connected to build larger circuits, including the Boolean-complete NOR gate and a 3-gate circuit consisting of four layered sgRNAs. The synthetic circuits were connected to the native E. coli regulatory network by designing output sgRNAs to target an E. coli transcription factor (malT). This converts the output of a synthetic circuit to a switch in cellular phenotype (sugar utilization, chemotaxis, phage resistance).},

abstract = {With the expanding interest in cellular responses to dynamic environments, microfluidic devices have become important experimental platforms for biological research. Microfluidic “microchemostat” devices enable precise environmental control while capturing high quality, single-cell gene expression data. For studies of population heterogeneity and gene expression noise, these abilities are crucial. Here, we describe the necessary steps for experimental microfluidics using devices created in our lab as examples. First, we discuss the rational design of microchemostats and the tools available to predict their performance. We carefully analyze the critical parts of an example device, focusing on the most important part of any microchemostat: the cell trap. Next, we present a method for generating on-chip dynamic environments using an integrated fluidic junction coupled to linear actuators. Our system relies on the simple modulation of hydrostatic pressure to alter the mixing ratio between two source reservoirs and we detail the software and hardware behind it. To expand the throughput of microchemostat experiments, we describe how to build larger, parallel versions of simpler devices. To analyze the large amounts of data, we discuss methods for automated cell tracking, focusing on the special problems presented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. The manufacturing of microchemostats is described in complete detail: from the photolithographic processing of the wafer to the final bonding of the PDMS chip to glass coverslip. Finally, the procedures for conducting Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae microchemostat experiments are addressed.},

@article{Stricker2008,
abstract = {One defining goal of synthetic biology is the development of engineering-based approaches that enable the construction of gene-regulatory networks according to 'design specifications' generated from computational modelling. This approach provides a systematic framework for exploring how a given regulatory network generates a particular phenotypic behaviour. Several fundamental gene circuits have been developed using this approach, including toggle switches and oscillators, and these have been applied in new contexts such as triggered biofilm development and cellular population control. Here we describe an engineered genetic oscillator in Escherichia coli that is fast, robust and persistent, with tunable oscillatory periods as fast as 13 min. The oscillator was designed using a previously modelled network architecture comprising linked positive and negative feedback loops. Using a microfluidic platform tailored for single-cell microscopy, we precisely control environmental conditions and monitor oscillations in individual cells through multiple cycles. Experiments reveal remarkable robustness and persistence of oscillations in the designed circuit; almost every cell exhibited large-amplitude fluorescence oscillations throughout observation runs. The oscillatory period can be tuned by altering inducer levels, temperature and the media source. Computational modelling demonstrates that the key design principle for constructing a robust oscillator is a time delay in the negative feedback loop, which can mechanistically arise from the cascade of cellular processes involved in forming a functional transcription factor. The positive feedback loop increases the robustness of the oscillations and allows for greater tunability. Examination of our refined model suggested the existence of a simplified oscillator design without positive feedback, and we construct an oscillator strain confirming this computational prediction.},

Communities of soil microorganisms perform critical functions: controlling climate, enhancing crop production, and remediation of environmental contamination. Microbial communities in the oral cavity and the gut are of high biomedical interest. Understanding and harnessing the function of these communities is difficult: artificial microbial communities in the laboratory become unstable because of "winner-takes-all" competition among species. We constructed a community of three different species of wild-type soil bacteria with syntrophic interactions using a microfluidic device to control spatial structure and chemical communication. We found that defined microscale spatial structure is both necessary and sufficient for the stable coexistence of interacting bacterial species in the synthetic community. A mathematical model describes how spatial structure can balance the competition and positive interactions within the community, even when the rates of production and consumption of nutrients by species are mismatched, by exploiting nonlinearities of these processes. These findings provide experimental and modeling evidence for a class of communities that require microscale spatial structure for stability, and these results predict that controlling spatial structure may enable harnessing the function of natural and synthetic multispecies communities in the laboratory.},

The predator cells kill the prey by inducing expression of a killer protein in the prey, while the prey rescue the predators by eliciting expression of an antidote protein in the predator. Extinction, coexistence and oscillatory dynamics of the predator and prey populations are possible depending on the operating conditions as experimentally validated by long-term culturing of the system in microchemostats.

abstract = {A cell in vivo is part of a large, networked community. An individual cell's fate is strongly influenced by its interactions with neighbouring cells. While this interaction has been recognized as critical in determining cell behaviour, its complexity and heterogeneity has thus far defied characterization by currently available techniques. Herein, we present a single-cell level co-culture platform for studies of dynamic cellular interactions, which is capable of maintaining and tracking single-cell pair interactions to simplify the complexity of intercellular communication. In this platform, heterotypic pairing on a single-cell level is achieved through sequential cell trapping and dynamic variation of fluidic resistance. Individual culture chambers provide trapped cells enough space to migrate and proliferate through multiple generations. Furthermore, the semi-isolated chambers, combined with continuously refreshed medium supplement, allow a stable communication environment around the cells. To demonstrate the platform capability, we cultured and tracked stem cell-fibroblast pairs for several generations. The subsequent effects of cell–cell interactions were then easily observed, due to the addressability of each isolated chamber, and quantitatively characterized. Specifically, we found that paired cells' migration patterns were dependent on their initial distance from each other, and that heterotypic pairing led to distinct proliferation patterns from homotypic, single-cell culture. This study demonstrates the platform utility in providing a detailed and quantitative understanding of the complexity of cellular communication and its effects on cell behaviour in a variety of biological systems.},

The guiding principle appears to be that each cell, during one generation, adds a size increment that is uncorrelated to its birth size. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying this “adder” behavior by mapping the chromosome replication cycle to the division cycle of individual cells using fluorescence microscopy. We have found that initiation of chromosome replication is triggered at a fixed volume per chromosome independent of a cell's birth volume and growth rate. Each initiation event is coupled to a division event after a growth-rate-dependent time. We formalize our findings in a model showing that cell-to-cell variation in division timing and cell size is mainly driven by variations in growth rate. The model also explains why fast-growing cells display adder behavior and correctly predict deviations from the adder behavior at slow growth.},

Because production is stochastic,many cells have no Adamolecules and cannot inducethedamageresponseuntil thefirst expression event occurs, which sometimes delays the response for generations.This creates a subpopulation of cells with increased mutation rates.

abstract = {The interaction between a pathogen and a host is a highly dynamic process in which both agents activate complex programs. Here, we introduce a single-cell RNA-sequencing method, scDual-Seq, that simultaneously captures both host and pathogen transcriptomes. We use it to study the process of infection of individual mouse macrophages with the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. Among the infected macrophages, we find three subpopulations and we show evidence for a linear progression through these subpopulations, supporting a model in which these three states correspond to consecutive stages of infection.},

abstract = {Intracellular bacterial pathogens can exhibit large heterogeneity in growth rate inside host cells, with major consequences for the infection outcome. If and how the host responds to this heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Here, we combined a fluorescent reporter of bacterial cell division with single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis to study the macrophage response to different intracellular states of the model pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The transcriptomes of individual infected macrophages revealed a spectrum of functional host response states to growing and non-growing bacteria. Intriguingly, macrophages harbouring non-growing Salmonella display hallmarks of the proinflammatory M1 polarization state and differ little from bystander cells, suggesting that non-growing bacteria evade recognition by intracellular immune receptors. By contrast, macrophages containing growing bacteria have turned into an anti-inflammatory, M2-like state, as if fast-growing intracellular Salmonella overcome host defence by reprogramming macrophage polarization. Additionally, our clustering approach reveals intermediate host functional states between these extremes. Altogether, our data suggest that gene expression variability in infected host cells shapes different cellular environments, some of which may favour a growth arrest of Salmonella facilitating immune evasion and the establishment of a long-term niche, while others allow Salmonella to escape intracellular antimicrobial activity and proliferate.},

With the t test, confidence intervals for parameters can be calculated and can be used to distinguish between models. In the F test, the lack of fit of the models is compared with the measuring error. Moreover, the models were compared with respect to their ease of use. All sigmoidal functions were modified so that they contained biologically relevant parameters. The models of Richards, Schnute, and Stannard appeared to be basically the same equation. In the cases tested, the modified Gompertz equation was statistically sufficient to describe the growth data of Lactobacillus plantarum and was easy to use.},

abstract = {AIMS: To determine the underlying substrate utilization mechanism in the logistic equation for batch microbial growth by revealing the relationship between the logistic and Monod kinetics. Also, to determine the logistic rate constant in terms of Monod kinetic constants. METHODS AND RESULTS: The logistic equation used to describe batch microbial growth was related to the Monod kinetics and found to be first-order in terms of the substrate and biomass concentrations. The logistic equation constant was also related to the Monod kinetic constants. Similarly, the substrate utilization kinetic equations were derived by using the logistic growth equation and related to the Monod kinetics. CONCLUSION: It is revaled that the logistic growth equation is a special form of the Monod growth kinetics when substrate limitation is first-order with respect to the substrate concentration. The logistic rate constant (k) is directly proportional to the maximum specific growth rate constant (mu(m)) and initial substrate concentration (S(0)) and also inversely related to the saturation constant (K(s)). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The semi-empirical logistic equation can be used instead of Monod kinetics at low substrate concentrations to describe batch microbial growth using the relationship between the logistic rate constant and the Monod kinetic constants.},

Elucidating these relations is important both for understanding the physiological functions of endogenous genetic circuits and for designing robust synthetic systems. We describe a phenomenological study that reveals intrinsic constraints governing the allocation of resources toward protein synthesis and other aspects of cell growth. A theory incorporating these constraints can accurately predict how cell proliferation and gene expression affect one another, quantitatively accounting for the effect of translation-inhibiting antibiotics on gene expression and the effect of gratuitous protein expression on cell growth. The use of such empirical relations, analogous to phenomenological laws, may facilitate our understanding and manipulation of complex biological systems before underlying regulatory circuits are elucidated.},

We describe the application of this method to imaging bacteria by using an automated microscopy system. This protocol has been used to analyze sporulation and competence differentiation in Bacillus subtilis, and to quantify gene regulation and its fluctuations in individual Escherichia coli cells. The protocol involves seeding and growing bacteria on small agarose pads and imaging the resulting microcolonies. Images are then reviewed and analyzed using our laboratory's custom MATLAB analysis code, which segments and tracks cells in a frame-to-frame method. This process yields quantitative expression data on cell lineages, which can illustrate dynamic expression profiles and facilitate mathematical models of gene circuits. With fast-growing bacteria, such as E. coli or B. subtilis, image acquisition can be completed in 1 d, with an additional 1-2 d for progressing through the analysis procedure.},

@article{Wang2010,
abstract = {The quantitative study of the cell growth [1-5] has led to many fundamental insights in our understanding of a wide range of subjects, from the cell cycle [6-9] to senescence [10]. Of particular importance is the growth rate, whose constancy represents a physiological steady state of an organism. Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically [11] and symmetrically [12, 13] dividing organisms, implying that a "steady-state" population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady-state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age. Our analysis of approximately 105 individual cells reveals a remarkable stability of growth whereby the mother cell inherits the same pole for hundreds of generations. We further show that death of E. coli is not purely stochastic but is the result of accumulating damages. We conclude that E. coli, unlike all other aging model systems studied to date, has a robust mechanism of growth that is decoupled from cell death. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Moffitt2012,
abstract = {Optical microscopy of single bacteria growing on solid agarose support is a powerful method for studying the natural heterogeneity in growth and gene expression. While the material properties of agarose make it an excellent substrate for such studies, the sheer number of exponentially growing cells eventually overwhelms the agarose pad, which fundamentally limits the duration and the throughput of measurements. Here we overcome the limitations of exponential growth by patterning agarose pads on the sub-micron-scale. Linear tracks constrain the growth of bacteria into a high density array of linear micro-colonies. Buffer flow through microfluidic lines washes away excess cells and delivers fresh nutrient buffer. Densely patterned tracks allow us to cultivate and image hundreds of thousands of cells on a single agarose pad over 30-40 generations, which drastically increases single-cell measurement throughput. In addition, we show that patterned agarose can facilitate single-cell measurements within bacterial communities. As a proof-of-principle, we study a community of E. coli auxotrophs that can complement the amino acid deficiencies of one another. We find that the growth rate of colonies of one strain decreases sharply with the distance to colonies of the complementary strain over distances of only a few cell lengths. Because patterned agarose pads maintain cells in a chemostatic environment in which every cell can be imaged, we term our device the single-cell chemostat. High-throughput measurements of single cells growing chemostatically should greatly facilitate the study of a variety of microbial behaviours.},

@article{Gurjav2016,
abstract = {In recent years the State of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, has maintained a low tuberculosis incidence rate with little evidence of local transmission. Nearly 90{\%} of notified tuberculosis cases occurred in people born in tuberculosis-endemic countries. We analyzed geographic, epidemiological and genotypic data of all culture-confirmed tuberculosis cases to identify the bacterial and demographic determinants of tuberculosis hotspot areas in NSW. Standard 24-loci mycobacterium interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-24) typing was performed on all isolates recovered between 2009 and 2013. In total 1692/1841 (91.9{\%}) cases with confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection had complete MIRU-24 and demographic data and were included in the study. Despite some year-to-year variability, spatio-temporal analysis identified four tuberculosis hotspots. The incidence rate and the relative risk of tuberculosis in these hotspots were 2- to 10-fold and 4- to 8-fold higher than the state average, respectively. MIRU-24 profiles of M. tuberculosis isolates associated with these hotspots revealed high levels of heterogeneity. This suggests that these spatio-temporal hotspots, within this low incidence setting, can represent areas of predominantly imported infection rather than clusters of cases due to local transmission. These findings provide important epidemiological insight and demonstrate the value of combining tuberculosis genotyping and spatiotemporal data to guide better-targeted public health interventions.},

abstract = {Fluorescent proteins (FPs) from the GFP family have become indispensable as marker tools for imaging live cells, tissues and entire organisms. A wide variety of these proteins have been isolated from natural sources and engineered to optimize their properties as genetically encoded markers. Here we review recent developments in this field. A special focus is placed on photoactivatable FPs, for which the fluorescence emission can be controlled by light irradiation at specific wavelengths. They enable regional optical marking in pulse-chase experiments on live cells and tissues, and they are essential marker tools for live-cell optical imaging with super-resolution. Photoconvertible FPs, which can be activated irreversibly via a photo-induced chemical reaction that either turns on their emission or changes their emission wavelength, are excellent markers for localization-based super-resolution microscopy (e.g., PALM). Patterned illumination microscopy (e.g., RESOLFT), however, requires markers that can be reversibly photoactivated many times. Photoswitchable FPs can be toggled repeatedly between a fluorescent and a non-fluorescent state by means of a light-induced chromophore isomerization coupled to a protonation reaction. We discuss the mechanistic origins of the effect and illustrate how photoswitchable FPs are employed in RESOLFT imaging. For this purpose, special FP variants with low switching fatigue have been introduced in recent years. Despite nearly two decades of FP engineering by many laboratories, there is still room for further improvement of these important markers for live cell imaging.},

However, so far, single-cell RNA-seq analysis has been used mostly for higher organisms. For microorganisms, single-cell RNA-seq has not been widely used, mainly because the stiff cell wall prevents effective lysis, much less starting RNA material is obtained, and the RNA lacks polyadenylated tails for universal priming of mRNA molecules. In general, the detection efficiency of current single-cell RNA-seq technologies is very low, and further development or improvement of these technologies is required for exploring the microbial world at single-cell resolution.

abstract = {Total transcript amplification (TTA) from single eukaryotic cells for transcriptome analysis is established, but TTA from a single prokaryotic cell presents additional challenges with much less starting material, the lack of poly(A)-tails, and the fact that the messages can be polycistronic. Here, we describe a novel method for single-bacterium TTA using a model organism, Burkholderia thailandensis, exposed to a subinhibitory concentration of the antibacterial agent, glyphosate. Utilizing a B. thailandensis microarray to assess the TTA method showed low fold-change bias (less than twofold difference and Pearson correlation coefficient R ≈ 0.87-0.89) and drop-outs (4{\%}-6{\%} of 2842 detectable genes), compared with data obtained from the larger-scale nonamplified RNA samples. Further analysis of the microarray data suggests that B. thailandensis, when exposed to the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis inhibitor glyphosate, induces (or represses) genes to possibly recuperate and balance the intracellular amino acid pool. We validated our single-cell microarray data at the multi-cell and single-cell levels with lacZ and gfp reporter-gene fusions, respectively. Sanger sequencing of 192 clones generated from the TTA product of a single cell, with and without enrichment by elimination of rRNA and tRNA, detected only B. thailandensis sequences with no contamination. These data indicate that RNA-seq of TTA from a single cell is possible using this novel method.},

abstract = {Until recently, transcriptome analyses of single cells have been confined to eukaryotes. The information obtained from single-cell transcripts can provide detailed insight into spatiotemporal gene expression, and it could be even more valuable if expanded to prokaryotic cells. Transcriptome analysis of single prokaryotic cells is a recently developed and powerful tool. Here we describe a procedure that allows amplification of the total transcript of a single prokaryotic cell for in-depth analysis. This is performed by using a laser-capture microdissection instrument for single-cell isolation, followed by reverse transcription via Moloney murine leukemia virus, degradation of chromosomal DNA with McrBC and DpnI restriction enzymes, single-stranded cDNA (ss-cDNA) ligation using T4 polynucleotide kinase and CircLigase, and polymerization of ss-cDNA to double-stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) by $\Phi$29 polymerase. This procedure takes ∼5 d, and sufficient amounts of ds-cDNA can be obtained from single-cell RNA template for further microarray analysis.},

abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms are ubiquitous in biological systems. Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-lambda, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks and in the decrease of precision of cell signals. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

abstract = {Multistability, the capacity to achieve multiple internal states in response to a single set of external inputs, is the defining characteristic of a switch. Biological switches are essential for the determination of cell fate in multicellular organisms, the regulation of cell-cycle oscillations during mitosis and the maintenance of epigenetic traits in microbes. The multistability of several natural and synthetic systems has been attributed to positive feedback loops in their regulatory networks. However, feedback alone does not guarantee multistability. The phase diagram of a multistable system, a concise description of internal states as key parameters are varied, reveals the conditions required to produce a functional switch. Here we present the phase diagram of the bistable lactose utilization network of Escherichia coli. We use this phase diagram, coupled with a mathematical model of the network, to quantitatively investigate processes such as sugar uptake and transcriptional regulation in vivo. We then show how the hysteretic response of the wild-type system can be converted to an ultrasensitive graded response. The phase diagram thus serves as a sensitive probe of molecular interactions and as a powerful tool for rational network design.},

Nineteen clock mutations were mapped to the three kai genes. Promoter activities upstream of the kaiA and kaiB genes showed circadian rhythms of expression, and both kaiA and kaiBC messenger RNAs displayed circadian cycling. Inactivation of any single kai gene abolished these rhythms and reduced kaiBC-promoter activity. Continuous kaiC overexpression repressed the kaiBC promoter, whereas kaiA overexpression enhanced it. Temporal kaiC overexpression reset the phase of the rhythms. Thus, a negative feedback control of kaiC expression by KaiC generates a circadian oscillation in cyanobacteria, and KaiA sustains the oscillation by enhancing kaiC expression},

    abstract = {Networks of interacting biomolecules carry out many essential functions in living cells, but the 'design principles' underlying the functioning of such intracellular networks remain poorly understood, despite intensive efforts including quantitative analysis of relatively simple systems. Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such 'rational network design may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

Linear amplification based on cDNA synthesis and in vitro transcription is reported to maintain representation of mRNA levels, however, quantitative data demonstrating this as well as a description of inherent limitations is lacking. We show that published protocols produce a template-independent product in addition to amplifying real target mRNA thus reducing the specific activity of the final product. We describe a modified amplification protocol that minimizes the generation of template-independent product and can therefore generate the desired microgram quantities of message-derived material from 100 ng of total RNA. Application of a second, nested round of cDNA synthesis and in vitro transcription reduces the required starting material to 2 ng of total RNA. Quantitative analysis of these products on Caenorhabditis elegans Affymetrix GeneChips shows that this amplification does not reduce overall sensitivity and has only minor effects on fidelity.},

However, the recent studies have shown that the individual behavior of each single cell could be quite different from that of the whole population, suggesting the importance of extending traditional microbiology studies to single-cell level. With recent technological advances, such as flow cytometry, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and microspectroscopy, single-cell microbiology has greatly enhanced the understanding of individuality and heterogeneity of microbes in many biological systems. Notably, the application of multiple 'omics' in single-cell analysis has shed light on how individual cells perceive, respond, and adapt to the environment, how heterogeneity arises under external stress and finally determines the fate of the whole population, and how microbes survive under natural conditions. As single-cell analysis involves no axenic cultivation of target microorganism, it has also been demonstrated as a valuable tool for dissecting the microbial 'dark matter.' In this review, current state-of-the-art tools and methods for genomic and transcriptomic analysis of microbes at single-cell level were critically summarized, including single-cell isolation methods and experimental strategies of single-cell analysis with NGS. In addition, perspectives on the future trends of technology development in the field of single-cell analysis was also presented.},

abstract = {Rolling-circle amplification (RCA) driven by DNA polymerase can replicate circularized oligonucleotide probes with either linear or geometric kinetics under isothermal conditions. In the presence of two primers, one hybridizing to the + strand, and the other, to the - strand of DNA, a complex pattern of DNA strand displacement ensues that generates 10(9) or more copies of each circle in 90 minutes, enabling detection of point mutations in human genomic DNA. Using a single primer, RCA generates hundreds of tandemly linked copies of a covalently closed circle in a few minutes. If matrix-associated, the DNA product remains bound at the site of synthesis, where it may be tagged, condensed and imaged as a point light source. Linear oligonucleotide probes bound covalently on a glass surface can generate RCA signals, the colour of which indicates the allele status of the target, depending on the outcome of specific, target-directed ligation events. As RCA permits millions of individual probe molecules to be counted and sorted using colour codes, it is particularly amenable for the analysis of rare somatic mutations. RCA also shows promise for the detection of padlock probes bound to single-copy genes in cytological preparations.},

abstract = {For many decades, the wedding of quantitative data with mathematical modeling has been fruitful, leading to important biological insights. Here, we review some of the ongoing efforts to gain insights into problems in microbiology – and, in particular, cell-cycle progression and its regulation – through observation and quantitative analysis of the natural fluctuations in the system. We first illustrate this idea by reviewing a classic example in microbiology – the Luria–Delbr{\"{u}}ck experiment – and discussing how, in that case, useful information was obtained by looking beyond the mean outcome of the experiment, but instead paying attention to the variability between replicates of the experiment. We then switch gears to the contemporary problem of cell cycle progression and discuss in more detail how insights into cell size regulation and, when relevant, coupling between the cell cycle and the circadian clock, can be gained by studying the natural fluctuations in the system and their statistical properties. We end with a more general discussion of how (in this context) the correct level of phenomenological model should be chosen, as well as some of the pitfalls associated with this type of analysis. Throughout this review the emphasis is not on providing details of the experimental setups or technical details of the models used, but rather, in fleshing out the conceptual structure of this particular approach to the problem. For this reason, we choose to illustrate the framework on a rather broad range of problems, and on organisms from all domains of life, to emphasize the commonality of the ideas and analysis used (as well as their differences).},

    abstract = {Chemotaxis responses in Escherichia coli are mediated by the phosphorylated response-regulator protein P-CheY. Biochemical and genetic studies have established the mechanisms by which the various components of the chemotaxis system, the membrane receptors and Che proteins function to modulate levels of CheY phosphorylation. Detailed models have been formulated to explain chemotaxis sensing in quantitative terms; however, the models cannot be adequately tested without knowledge of the quantitative relationship between P-CheY and bacterial swimming behavior. A computerized image analysis system was developed to collect extensive statistics on freeswimming and individual tethered cells. P-CheY levels were systematically varied by controlled expression of CheY in an E.coli strain lacking the CheY phosphatase, CheZ, and the receptor demethylating enzyme CheB. Tumbling frequency was found to vary with P-CheY concentration in a weakly sigmoidal fashion (apparent Hill coefficient approximately 2.5). This indicates that the high sensitivity of the chemotaxis system is not derived from highly cooperative interactions between P-CheY and the flagellar motor, but rather depends on nonlinear effects within the chemotaxis signal transduction network. The complex relationship between single flagella rotation and free-swimming behavior was examined; our results indicate that there is an additional level of information processing associated with interactions between the individual flagella. An allosteric model of the motor switching process is proposed which gives a good fit to the observed switching induced by P-CheY. Thus the level of intracellular P-CheY can be estimated from behavior determinations: approximately 30{\%} of the intracellular pool of CheY appears to be phosphorylated in fully adapted wild-type cells.},

@article{Manz1993,
abstract = {Free-water-phase and surface-associated microorganisms from drinking water were detected and roughly identified by hybridization with fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotide probes complementary to regions of 16S and 23S rRNA characteristic for the domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eucarya and the beta and gamma subclasses of Proteobacteria. Samples of glass-attached biofilms and plankton were taken from a Robbins device installed in a water distribution system. More than 70{\%} of the surface-associated cells and less than 40{\%} of the planktonic cells visualized by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining bound detectable amounts of rRNA-targeted probes. These findings are an indication for higher average rRNA content and consequently higher physiological activity of the attached microbial cells compared with the free-living cells. All detectable cells hybridized with the bacterial probe, whereas no Archaea and no Eucarya cells could be detected. Simultaneous hybridization with probes specific for the beta and gamma subclasses of Proteobacteria revealed that microcolonies already consisted of mixed populations in early stages with fewer than 50 cells. These observations provide further evidence that the coexistence and interaction of bacteria in drinking water biofilms may be an integral part of their growth and survival strategies.},

@article{Amann1995,
abstract = {The frequent discrepancy between direct microscopic counts and numbers of culturable bacteria from environmental samples is just one of several indications that we currently know only a minor part of the diversity of microorganisms in nature. A combination of direct retrieval of rRNA sequences and whole-cell oligonucleotide probing can be used to detect specific rRNA sequences of uncultured bacteria in natural samples and to microscopically identify individual cells. Studies have been performed with microbial assemblages of various complexities ranging from simple two-component bacterial endosymbiotic associations to multispecies enrichments containing magnetotactic bacteria to highly complex marine and soil communities. Phylogenetic analysis of the retrieved rRNA sequence of an uncultured microorganism reveals its closest culturable relatives and may, together with information on the physicochemical conditions of its natural habitat, facilitate more directed cultivation attempts. For the analysis of complex communities such as multispecies biofilms and activated-sludge flocs, a different approach has proven advantageous. Sets of probes specific to different taxonomic levels are applied consecutively beginning with the more general and ending with the more specific (a hierarchical top-to-bottom approach), thereby generating increasingly precise information on the structure of the community. Not only do rRNA-targeted whole-cell hybridizations yield data on cell morphology, specific cell counts, and in situ distributions of defined phylogenetic groups, but also the strength of the hybridization signal reflects the cellular rRNA content of individual cells. From the signal strength conferred by a specific probe, in situ growth rates and activities of individual cells might be estimated for known species. In many ecosystems, low cellular rRNA content and/or limited cell permeability, combined with background fluorescence, hinders in situ identification of autochthonous populations. Approaches to circumvent these problems are discussed in detail.},
